# simple-sandbox
Docker based sandbox for smart apps

## Usage
Just `cd` into the project folder and run
```sh
docker-compose up
```
Then open http://localhost:4000 to get a page with links to everything else.

You can change the ports used by different services by editing the `.env` file (just don't commit it).
